Miss Elsy and her Student record

Miss Elsy has stored all the details of her students marks in a dictionary. The names of the student are arranged in the decreasing order of their marks. That is, the student which got the highest mark is the first element of the dictionary. Elsy Ma’am left her desktop open and a notorious student messed up her dictionary by changing the marks of all the students. Help her to get her original list back.
