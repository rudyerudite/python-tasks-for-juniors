## Bruteforce: is it a force?
What would you do if you are given a bunch of keys and asked to open a lock? There will be only one key out of that bunch of keys which would open the lock. So you would keep trying to open the lock with different keys from the big lot given to you. Phew! Tough isn’t?
Do you know in the history of Cryptography many encryptions had been broken by using similar way of guessing the keys? This way of guessing the keys to break encryption of a plaintext (or to crack a secret information) is known as **“bruteforce”.**

In the previous section we discussed about keys. In cryptography,**key length** stands for the length of the key. If they key to a cryptosystem is short then an attcaker can easily **bruteforce** it and break the cryptosystem.
Also, the set of different keys which can be used to break the cryptosystem is called **keyspace.** A larger keyspace also ensures better security.
