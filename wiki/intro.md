# Introduction to Cryptography
 
**Have you ever wished you could communicate with someone in a language which no other third person could understand?**
**Have you ever wondered how each of your facebook chats is secured?**
**Has it ever crossed your mind how each of the ATM transaction made by your parents is secured?**

It is **Cryptography**,which underlies in each answer to the above questions. #TBM
Let’s explore this art further which dates back to 1900 BC and without which nothing in this world would had been secured!

### What is Cryptography?
The word “Cryptography” gets it roots from two greek words “cryptos” and “graphein” which when put together simply imply translating messages into a “secret language”.  In formal terms, Cryptography is the art of converting information into an unintelligible form so that no unauthorized person can understand it.

### Importance of Cryptography
Have you ever sold your old smartphone to someone recently? Do you think “restore to factory settings” can help you erase all your personal data? If yes, then you are wrong! Your data can still be retrieved back. One way of solving this is to change all your data to a different form such that no unauthorized erson can get your original data back. Well, cryptography is used everywhere to ensure that all the information transfer accross different channels happens securely. Your ATM transcations are all secured with the magic of cryptography! In the next section we'll understand the basic terms used in cryptography.
